### Dollar Ducky
[Dollar Ducky] (http://dollarducky.herokuapp.com) is a personal finance app that will help you get all your financial ducks in a row. It offers spending overviews, bill tracking, budgeting, purchase planning, a financial decision calculator, and a chatbot built with the Twilio API that you can text for information about any of the above. It integrates with the Plaid API to pull transaction information from your bank. Built in 2 weeks by a team of 3. If you'd like to try it out with the link above, please make sure to use the sandbox credentials provided when linking a bank. Click on the photo below to see a video of our presentation.

### MusicMates
[Music Mates] (https://musicmates-stackathon.herokuapp.com) integrates with your Spotify account in order to compare your music tastes with those of a friend. Entering another user's Spotify ID will display a radar graph of a comparison of your favorite genres. Because of the nature of Spotify's API, there's no direct way to extract genres from a user's playlist, meaning I had to make thousands of API calls to gather my data. This project taught me so much about APIs, rate limiting, throttling, and the value of caching. Built in about 3 days.

TECH: JS, Spotify API, React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Material UI
