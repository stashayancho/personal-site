I didn't always know I wanted to be a software developer. Many people in this field seem to have been computer nerds since they were kids, whereas I always preferred analog puzzles. I carried puzzle books with me everywhere I went and got to college thinking I'd become a cryptologist. That dream didn't survive freshman-year linear algebra, and unfortunately I was unaware at the time just how similar computer programming is to what I wanted to do. Instead I turned to international relations and Russian language, and after graduation I moved to Russia to teach English. My time in Russia taught me the true meaning of tenacity and also led me to discover my passion for coding. I love the fact that the puzzles I solve now have a reward at the end -- bringing to life an idea.
